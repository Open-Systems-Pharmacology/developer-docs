# About this Documentation

This documentation describes the [Open Systems Pharmacology Codebase](https://github.com/Open-Systems-Pharmacology). Its main aim is to facilitate easier onboarding of new developers to OSPSuite platform. Additionally, it functions as a documentation of the design decisions and provides an overview of the Suite.&#x20;

However, the goal is not to document the implementation per se, developers should be able to use Visual Studio or RStudio to understand those details. Therefore, the goal of this repository is not to duplicate the details of the implementation in written form, but to provide enough detail that a developer starting on the project should be able to more quickly understand the design decisions. That should make it easier to understand the implementation through reading the code itself.
