## Algorithm for the creation of a new individual

When OSPSuite creates a new individual given input data, there is one of two algorithms being used: There is the algorithm for species that are not age  dependant 
and 
There is the more complicated algorithm for age dependant species that.

Both algorithms can be found in more detail here:
